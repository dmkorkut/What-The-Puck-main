                    <p className="text-lg">
                        Originally designed for junior hockey teams, this project is currently a <strong>proof of concept</strong> 
                         that analyzes <strong>NHL player performance</strong>. While it does not provide real-time statistics, it 
                        evaluates players based on a range of factors, generating a <strong>performance rating</strong> and 
                        making all data accessible to <strong>players, coaches, and team staff</strong>.

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How It Works</h2>
                    <p className="text-lg">
                        Our system takes detailed <strong>NHL player data</strong> and analyzes various aspects of their game, 
                        including:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-lg">
                        <li>Scoring efficiency relative to ice time</li>
                        <li>Offensive vs. defensive impact</li>
                        <li>Contribution in different game situations (power play, penalty kill, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Comparisons to similar players based on historical data</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="text-lg mt-4">
                        Using this analysis, we assign players a <strong>performance rating</strong> that gives deeper insight 
                        beyond traditional stats like goals and assists.

                    <p className="text-lg">
                        Our platform allows <strong>players, coaches, and staff</strong> to access performance insights, helping:

                    <p className="text-lg">
                        While our current system only works with NHL data, the long-term goal remains the same: 
                        bringing advanced analytics to <strong>junior, semi-pro, and amateur hockey teams</strong>. Future iterations 
                        will explore how to adapt these insights for lower levels of play, making hockey analytics <strong>more accessible for everyone</strong>.
